# PDP-Front-end

PDP(Product Development Programme) is a one-year long project, our team built a prototype for Heureka.

Our prototype aims at inspiring children of ANN(Artificial Neural Network), there is a pad at the end of this prototype, where users can draw everything they want, and the ANN algorithm would detect it and give 3 most possible numbers (0-9) based on input and show it at the top panel, the most possible number would be displayed at the bottom panel. 

This repository is a subfile of Gradio, which is our benchmark of front-end, to make our prototype more user-centric, we changed the style to make it more interesting for children.
